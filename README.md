# FizzBuzz


## FizzBuzz Python:
To execute fizzbuzz program just run the fizzbuzz.py file.It will show you 100 fizzbuzz numbers.
For Testing purpose, I chose unittest library to test the fizzbuzz function which will show only first three numbers just for demonstration.You can increase numbers in testing as required.
### Note: I have used list in python so that unittest would know the output is correct or not.

## FizzBuzz PHP:
I used same logic in PHP program nd it will show you first 15 fizzbuzz number but it can be changed to 100 numbers if you want.
